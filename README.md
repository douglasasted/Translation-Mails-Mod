The mod was created in january of 2024 and posted again on this repository in march of 2024. The mod cant be used as is on the file, because it requires a OpenAI Chat-GPT token to be put in "Translation Manager".
The mod has two problems that stops it from having a public release version:
1. It doesn't have at the moment any way of encrypting the OpenAI token;
2. The OpenAI can only be selected within the codes of the mod.
If you have interest in using the mod for any project you are free to use or transform, but credits would be nice!
Also, if you have a interest in a released version correcting the problems listed above or adding new features feel free to contact me.
